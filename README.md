# Exploring-67-years-of-LEGO

I used Pandas to analyze all LEGO sets since the company started making the interlocking brick toy in 1950. I discovered the average number of parts per set per year by grouping by year and then calculating the mean for all sets created that year. This showed a trend of a steady and gradual increase in the number of parts per set over the years.
